# waterline-rest

Provides easy access to REST APIs for Waterline models.

This module is a Waterline adapter, an early implementation of a rapidly-developing, tool-agnostic data standard.  Its goal is to provide a set of declarative interfaces, conventions, and best-practices for integrating with all sorts of data sources.  Not just databases-- external APIs, proprietary web services, or even hardware.

Strict adherence to an adapter specification enables the (re)use of built-in generic test suites, standardized documentation, reasonable expectations around the API for your users, and overall, a more pleasant development experience for everyone.
